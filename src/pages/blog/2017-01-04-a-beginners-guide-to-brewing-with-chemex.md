If you are planning to be a doctor, you’re probably used to hearing the word “pre-med” thrown around. For anyone, who is planning to attend a medical school, pre-med is oh so very important.

While the word might intimidate some, pre-med is simply used to refer to those students who are planning to go to medical schools and are therefore taking classes required to get in.



**Compulsory Classes**

Typically, most medical schools expect the students to take particular classes to prepare them with the content and rigor that goes along with being a pre-medical student. These consists of:



* 1 year of Biology with lab
* 1 year of Physics with lab
* 1 year of General Chemistry with lab
* 1 year of Organic Chemistry with lab
* 1 semester of Biochemistry
* Math (Statistics and/or Calculus)
* English



Keep in mind that each school has their own requirements, but these are the minimum, general classes that pre-meds are expected to complete. Along with these courses, there will obviously be other courses that you have to complete for your major and to apply to your desired medical school.



**MCAT**

Premeds are required to take the MCAT exam that provides a good idea to the med schools about the student’s expertise in Biology, General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physics, Psychology, and Sociology as well as the student’s proficiency in terms of critical analysis and reasoning skills. While the combined content on the MCAT is broken down into four test sections, each of these sections is scored from 118 to 132. To note, the total score ranges from 472 to 528. Although the average score on the MCAT is 500, the average score for students accepted into med school is close to 509.



**Research and Recommendations**

Even though good grades are important to get in med schools, you will definitely have the upper hand if you can get involved in any scientific research experience or something related to the medical field. Honestly, this not only reflects their commitment towards this profession but also hones many of their skills. Not only that, students are also required to provide the med schools with a minimum of three letters of recommendation from the professors.

In nutshell, if you are passionate about becoming a doctor, you should definitely do an extensive research on which college or pre-med program is the best suited for you and will help you the best in your career. Also, getting in contact with your school’s pre-med advisor early helps you to plan out how you are going to spend your undergraduate career. While it might be challenging or even confusing sometimes, choosing the right pre-med program is essential to reach your professional goals.
