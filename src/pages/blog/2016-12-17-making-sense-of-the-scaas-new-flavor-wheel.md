We are a group of students-just like you! We understand the hardships of the journey to medical school and want to be a part of yours. As you may know, it is hard to discern what prep is right for you or how you will be able to afford prep courses worth thousands of dollars. Our goal is to create a space where you can find tons of free resources and advice to help you achieve *your* goal of becoming a doctor. The process of preparing and applying for medical school can seem daunting, but through accessible tutoring and content, we aim to reduce the obstacles associated with it.

Not only that, but with the support of other students who are on the same path as you are, we aim to create a community where everyone can interact, engage and learn with each other. We understand the long nights and lonely days that go along with the process and want to help reduce that stress of navigating it on your own.

We would also like to introduce our very own tutoring program! With so many pricey options and everyone claiming to have the best MCAT tutoring out there, itâ€™s easy to become overwhelmed and left clueless. Offering free tutoring is just one of the many steps we are taking to fulfill our goal of providing accessible and reliable tutoring. All of our tutors have scored within the 95th percentile or higher on the sections that they tutor in.

Be on the lookout for new information and updates as we continue to expand! Connect with us on our social media to stay in the loop! Our Facebook offers even more free services so check those out!
