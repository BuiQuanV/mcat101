**Our Mission**

MCAT 101 is an organization that provides free tutoring services and resources for pre-med students, including free MCAT tutoring sessions, premed mentoring, resume editing, and more! Our mission is to make the MCAT prep more affordable and accessible and create a new platform to engage students in the process of their prep as well as encourage them to learn from each other and have fun during their premed journey!

**About Our Tutoring Services**

MCAT 101 provides free MCAT tutoring and resources from tutors that have scored in the 95th percentile in the subjects they are tutoring. We will also have volunteers that are currently studying for the MCAT leading topic sessions in concepts they have mastered.
